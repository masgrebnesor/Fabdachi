Thank you for visiting fabdachi.com! I will be creating a number of different pieces of Flesh and Blood content intended for primarly new players (but not exclusivley). The main projects will be:

1. <b>Buyer guides</b> for different heroes, including the most important legendaries for when buying on a budget.
    
2. <b>Regular "danger" ratings</b> for how likely heroes are to rotate via the living legend system.
    
3. <b>Living legend updates</b>.

4. <b>Decklists</b>, <b>meta reports</b>, and (potentially) <b>tournament reports</b>.

I hope you find something useful!
