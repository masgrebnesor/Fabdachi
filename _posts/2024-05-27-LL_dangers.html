    <p>The Flesh and Blood Living Legend system means that decks will rotate at irregular timings based on hw successful their heroes are at top-level competition. As a new, or even experienced player, it's important to consider when buying into a deck how long you expect to be able to play with your cards. This is a guide, written on May 27th, 2024, meant to inform how likely each of an array of decks are to Living Legend in the near future.</p>

        <th>Hero (Points)</th>

        <td>Katsu, The Wanderer (655)
        <a name="KatsuTheWanderer"></a></td>
        <td style="background: orange"></td>
        <td>Katsu is currently on the upper-end of the cast of heroes in the race to LL. With that said, it still has about 350 points of leeway, and thus far hasn't seen tremendous success at the highest level. Further, Zen is likely to take at least some ninja entusiasts away from Katsu. This may make the hero a little safer in the next couple seasons.</td>
