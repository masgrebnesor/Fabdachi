        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/surgingstriker.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/surgingstrikey.webp" /></div>
        <a name="SurgingStrike"></a></td>
        <td>Surging Strike in both Red and Yellow are critical to the Katsu combo-lines seen in pretty much every classic constructed deck. It's the starter for both the Lord of Wind and <a href="#BondsOfAncestry">Bonds of Ancestry</a> lines, and is pretty much required.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/descendentgustwaver.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/descendentgustwavey.webp" /></div></td>
        <td>Descendent Gustwave is a staple in the deck as well, also in red and yellow. The use of harmonized kodachi's prevent the usefulness of including blues. Many decks only run 1 or 2 yellows, but as a common, I'd reccomend just picking up 3 copies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/belikewaterr.webp" /></div></td>
        <td>Be Like Water is another 3 copies of almost <a href="#SurgingStrike">Surging Strike</a> and demands blocks, so it's essentially required. It's also a 0 cost for Katsu. It's also, like, 5 cents. </td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/whelminggustwaver.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/whelminggustwavey.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/whelminggustwaveb.webp" /></div>
        <a name="WhelmingGustwave"></a></td>
        <td>Whelming Gustwave is a great follow-up to Surging Strike, across all colors. A lot of decks only run Red and Blue. The 4 power breakpoint is very powerful, and the 0-cost blue works great with Harmonized Kodachi.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/bondsofancestryr.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/bondsofancestryy.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/bondsofancestryb.webp" /></div>
        <a name="BondsOfAncestry"></a></td>
        <td>Bonds of Ancestry has become central to the way the modern Katsu deck operates. Using the Katsu search, Mask of the Pouncing Lynx, and Breeze Rider Boots, you can stack several Bonds of Ancestry with gustwaves inbetween to deal massive amounts of damage, and potentially end with a must-block Dishonor. Decks generally only run 1 blue Bonds, as it's not a 0-cost to activate kodachi, and the number of yellows you play varies. I'd get 3, just in case.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/breakingscales.webp" /></div></td>
        <td>Breaking Scales is not only cheap, it's also best in slot for Katsu. It forces the opponent to overblock the entire game, until they don't, and then you kill them.</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/flicflakr.webp" /></div></td>
        <td>Flik Flac is an excellent defense reaction, that works well with all the blue combo cards we're already running. It's a sideboard card for certain matchups, that is especially good in more controlling decklists.</td>
    </tr>
         <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/flusterfistr.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/flusterfistb.webp" /></div></td>
        <td>Fluster Fist red does good damage with the 4 power breakpoint, and the blue 3-block 0-cost is good on it's own. Coupled with the <a href="#BondsOfAncestry">Bonds of Ancestry</a> synergy, and 3x of red and blue become staples.</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/hundredwindsr.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/hundredwindsy.webp" /></div>
            <div class="twoimage"><img src="/hundredwindsb.webp" /></div>
        <a name="HundredWinds"></a></td>
        <td>Most decks just run the red Hundred Winds, which is a powerful, potentially scaling, go again attack. It's held back by only having 2 block, but is great at buffing itself and Winds of Eternity. I think the others might be played more in the future, so it might be worth getting the whole set if you're getting into Ninja.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="twoimage"><img src="/spinningwheelkickr.webp" /></div>
        <a name="SpinningWheelKick"></a></td>
        <td>Spinning Wheel Kick is good (and bad) for the same reasons hundred winds is, but with a bit of every power in the attack column. 3 red copies is included in a large percentage of lists.</td>
